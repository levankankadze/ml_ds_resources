## definitions
**cardinality** is defined as the number of elements in a set or other grouping.

**Pearson correlation coefficient PCC**  is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data. It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables and the product of their standard deviations; thus, it is essentially a normalized measurement of the covariance, such that the result always has a value between −1 and 1. As with covariance itself, the measure can only reflect a linear correlation of variables, and ignores many other types of relationships or correlations. As a simple example, one would expect the age and height of a sample of teenagers from a high school to have a Pearson correlation coefficient significantly greater than 0, but less than 1 (as 1 would represent an unrealistically perfect correlation).

## Software
### [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
>TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use in research and production.

### [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
>PyTorch is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella. It is free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license.

### [Keras](https://keras.io/)

## Some questions
> Pandas has both isna() and isnull(). I usually use isnull() to detect missing values and have never met the case so that I had to use other than that. So, when to use isna()?
### Answer
isnull is an alias for isna. Literally in the code source of pandas:
```python
isnull = isna
```
Indeed:
```
>>> pd.isnull
<function isna at 0x7fb4c5cefc80>
```
So I would recommend using isna.

### 
> Accuracy and precision

Precision and accuracy are two ways that scientists think about error. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. Precision refers to how close measurements of the same item are to each other. Precision is independent of accuracy.
